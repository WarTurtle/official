### USU Biology Nerd Herd

  The USU Biology Nerd Herd is a group of USU graduate and undergraduate students in the Biology department that are interested in using technology to answer scientific questions. I have been a member of the USU Biology Nerd Herd Club since August of 2018. While school is in session, we hold weekly meetings in which we learn a new skill, work towards one of our long-term goals, or have a guest lecturer present their work. The Nerd Herd is led by Dr. William Pearse. 

  Itâ€™s a tradition of the Bio-Nerd Herd to have a Day of Code event. For one day, the entire club joins together in one room to follow through on an exciting coding idea. The members of the club through the 2017-2018 academic year produced R packages that create databases of traits and ecological communities. You can view the products of this effort at the Github pages for  MADtraits and MADcomm. I was not a member of the Bio-Nerd Herd during the development of these packages.
