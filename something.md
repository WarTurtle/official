  The USU Biology Nerd Herd is a group of USU graduate and undergraduate students in the Biology department that are interested in using technology to answer scientific questions. I have been a member of the USU Biology Nerd Herd Club since August of 2018. While school is in session, we hold weekly meetings in which we learn a new skill, work towards one of our long-term goals, or have a guest lecturer present their work. The Nerd Herd is led by Dr. William Pearse. 


  Itâ€™s a tradition of the Bio-Nerd Herd to have a Day of Code event. For one day, the entire club joins together in one room to follow through on an exciting coding idea. The members of the club through the 2017-2018 academic year produced R packages that create databases of traits and ecological communities. You can view the products of this effort at the Github pages for  MADtraits and MADcomm. I was not a member of the Bio-Nerd Herd during the development of these packages.



## Apocalypse Game

  For the 2018-2019 Day of Code event, the Bio-Nerd Herd determined to create a browser game to communicate how the decisions that we make as individuals and as a community affect the *health of the landscape* around us. The game centers around a (rudimentary) map of Cache Valley in Utah, which is illustrated with bright colors. However, the story line quickly puts the user into the position of leader of the community. As the user makes decisions, the brightness of the colors on the map either brighten or darken to reflect changes in the health of the landscape. Links to research and popular science articles are provided to show how the management decisions made by the game's user are connected to the changes in habitat quality. 


  My largest contribution to the Apocalypse Game project was in writing the story and collecting the research for the links in the game. During the Day of Code, I contributed to the development of the javascript code for changing the game state, learning how to load json files containing the story line into the game, and creating documentation for the game. After the Day of Code, I cleaned up the group code so that the buttons worked and the game was playable. Considering that our group knew little about coding in javascript at the outset of this project, I consider Apocalypse Game to be a resounding success. In the coming year, we plan to add features to Apocalypse Game and make it more user friendly to K-12 teachers who may find it useful. The tone of the game is inspired by my experiences with interactive fiction.
