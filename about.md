I am recent graduate from the Biology program at Utah State University. I have three years of experience working as an undergraduate researcher. During that time, I have worked with agent based models to answer questions about how defaunation threatens biodiversity in Tropical forests. I am looking to find a graduate program in Ecology that will satisfy my interests for machine learning, biodiversity, and having fun. Since graduating college, I have formed a team of enthusiastic conservationists. Our goal is to find technological solutions to aide law enforcement in bringing wildlife trafficker to justice. Further information about this project can be found at [the Conservation X Website.](https://conservationx.com/project/key/trackingpangolinscales?fbclid=IwAR3cRb-2phCGI3b3syRfaJiVDu4PlNro0_fdK5iE-BYlFGxK8i4TYzJQ_6A)
