&nbsp;&nbsp;  Justin Tirrell graduated cum laude from Utah State University in the Spring of 2020 with a degree in Biology, minors in Philosophy and Chemistry, an undergraduate researcher designation, and Departmental Honors. During his time at Utah State University (USU), he engaged in the study of Ethics, participating in intra- and inter-collegiate Ethics Bowl competitions for his region. While at USU, Justin enjoyed participating in book clubs hosted through the Honors Department and through the Society for the Advancement of Ethical Leadership (SAEL).

&nbsp;&nbsp;  After taking a year long leave of absence, Justin embedded himself in the Ecology research community at USU. His enthusiasm for technology grew as he began attending coding competitions, hack-a-thons, monthly meetings for the local DefCon (435) group, and weekly meetings as part of the USU Biological Nerd Herd. In particular, Justin enjoyed engaging with the community as a volunteer. While a student, he spent time volunteering as a friend at the Kid’s Place, as a volunteer note-taker for the Disability Resource Center, and as the Head of Professional Development for the USU Science Council. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  Justin’s research allowed him to engage with regional and international investigators in answering scientific questions about biodiversity. He collaborated with USU professors to perform both greenhouse experiments and field experiments, and he supported fellow students as an Undergraduate Teaching Fellow. After 3 years of engagement with research, Justin has cultivated a passion for engaging in conservation, research, and open source communities.



&nbsp;&nbsp;  I recently graduated from the Biology program at Utah State University. I have three years of experience working as an undergraduate researcher. During that time, I have worked with agent based models to answer questions about how defaunation threatens biodiversity in Tropical forests. I am looking to find a graduate program in Ecology that will satisfy my interests for machine learning, biodiversity, and having fun. Since graduating college, I have formed a team of enthusiastic conservationists. Our goal is to find technological solutions to aide law enforcement in bringing wildlife trafficker to justice.
